rz-pointer


when we use index as a way to indirect address (for a pointer), we must be careful about addressing mode.

x = input()
c = x[0]                 use x as pointer, x is local

trap r0 #input
mov r1 r28               ;  get pointer to r1
mov r2 #0                ;  zero index
ld r3 +r1 r2           

but when x is global, we must derefence x once

x global

trap r0 #input
str r28 x
ld r1 x
mov r2 #0
ld r3 +r1 r2

this is different from declaring x as vector (static array)

x[20]

...
c = x[0]

mov r2 #0
ld r3 @x r2     ;  &x is known at compile time, x is static array
